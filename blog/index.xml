      <title>My 2021 in Tech</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is that time of the year again. Or, to be precise, it is 51 days after that time of &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; year. I&amp;rsquo;ve been remiss in my schedule for these posts. But it is the time when I reflect upon my growth in tech over the past year. Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ajmalsiddiqui.me/blog/my-2020-in-tech/&#34; title=&#34;My 2020 in Tech&#34;&gt;last years post&lt;/a&gt;, this one goes over what I learned, some of the opinions I formed, what I could have done better, and what I think I should focus on in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I do this primarily to track my progress, I do hope that those who read about my growth find it instructive, and walk away having gained something from it. With that happy thought, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your First Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://ajmalsiddiqui.me/blog/your-first-programming-language/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What programming language should you learn first? Back in University, juniors who wanted to get on the programming roller coaster often asked me this. After much deliberation, I think I have my answer. In this post I express why I think a lot of conventional wisdom here isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and what I suggest as the first language for getting started with coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Extending The Python Debugger</title>
      <link>https://ajmalsiddiqui.me/blog/extending-the-python-debugger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a little while now I&amp;rsquo;ve had this itch with pdb that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to scratch. I wanted a limited version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Hooks.html&#34; title=&#34;gdb User Defined Hooks&#34;&gt;the hooks feature from gdb&lt;/a&gt; so that I can automatically execute debugger commands each time execution stops. Today, I ended up scratching that itch by extending Pdb and coding in the functionality I needed. This post talks about how I did so and also covers a loosely organized collection of related Python debugger tricks that you may find useful (or at least fascinating).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diving Into Unfamiliar Codebases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re starting out in a new job or team, or if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to contribute to a Open Source project that you&amp;rsquo;re new to, having to familiarise yourself with an alien codebase is something a software dev will have to do at some point in their lives. You won&amp;rsquo;t start all projects from scratch. This isn&amp;rsquo;t easy by any measure (at least not for me), but I try to share some of the tricks that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up to get up to speed with a new codebase in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 has easily been the most profound year for me as a tech enthusiast. I graduated with a CS degree, got an amazing job, picked up 2 new languages (Go and Clojure), revisited 2 other langauges that I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; I knew but clearly didn&amp;rsquo;t (C and Rust), and explored many new domains (most notably cybersecurity and cloud engineering). This post is a loosely organized collection of my thoughts and experiences related to each of these items, as well as some insight into how I achieved some of the things I achieved this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be kind enough to indulge me, let&amp;rsquo;s start talking!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on the first article which introduces dotfiles, this one dives into the common challenges to managing dotfiles effectively. We look at approaches to organizing them, techniques to keep them in sync, bootstrapping fresh systems, committing them to version control, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article looks at the very basic elements of customizing your dotfiles and stepping up your workflows. We look at defining custom aliases and functions, and the rationale behind checking your dotfiles into version control. The article concludes with a few references to good dotfile repositories and a taste of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tag along for a quick tour of some of the weirder things about JavaScript syntax that, once you pick them up, will (hopefully) become indispensible parts of your JS codebases. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at the spread operator, IIFEs, and implicit returns in arrow functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Toolkit of a Full Stack Javascript Developer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript ecosystem of tools and technologies for building applications is neither small nor limited to the web. This article touches upon &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the options you have for technologies used to build web apps, cross platform applications, desktop apps, and more, while also talking about certain tools that aren&amp;rsquo;t a strict requirement for a full stack developer, but one that most devs probably can&amp;rsquo;t get very far without. Hop on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My Programming Journey I technically started &amp;ldquo;programming&amp;rdquo; when I was 11 or 12, and my first language was technically QBASIC. I say &amp;ldquo;technically&amp;rdquo; because the programs I wrote were often toy programs (I fondly remember being particularly proud of a program that printed the colours of the rainbow in order - and it didn&amp;rsquo;t even use a for loop. Just 7 print statements), and since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to a computer then, I wrote them in my notebook.</description>
