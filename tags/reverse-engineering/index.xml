      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a write-up for the &amp;ldquo;Password Here Please&amp;rdquo; reverse engineering challenge from &lt;a href=&#34;https://metactf.com/cybergames&#34; title=&#34;MetaCTF CyberGames 2020&#34;&gt;MetaCTF CyberGames 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was worth 325 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge statement: I forgot my bank account password! Luckily for me, I wrote a program that checks if my password is correct just in case I forgot which password I used, so this way I don&amp;rsquo;t lock myself out of my account. Unfortunately, I seem to have lost my password list as well&amp;hellip; Could you take a look and see if you can find my password for me? Part 3 requires some math skills. To solve it, think about what is being done by the exponentiation step. Try rewriting the large number in base 257.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
